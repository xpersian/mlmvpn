/*
 * «تونل گوگل اسکریپت» has two connection modes, and the third one stays gone.
 *
 * The full tunnel — a sing-box adapter feeding the whole machine into the engine's SOCKS port —
 * was removed on 2026-09-20 after three rounds of fixes, each of which uncovered the next
 * failure rather than the last one. What the rounds established, and what this suite protects:
 *
 *   · the engine is an HTTP relay. From its own dispatch log:
 *       example.com:443 -> MITM + Apps Script relay (TLS detected)
 *       github.com:22   -> raw-tcp (direct) (non-HTTP, non-TLS client payload)
 *       1.1.1.1:53      -> raw-tcp (direct) (non-HTTP, non-TLS client payload)
 *     A TUN hands an engine EVERY protocol the machine speaks; this one carries two of them.
 *
 * So the mode is not coming back by accident. The two things that can still go wrong are a
 * route quietly reappearing, and — much worse — a machine that HAD the mode switched on being
 * left with the adapter still holding the default route and nothing behind it. The teardown
 * paths are therefore kept, and tested here.
