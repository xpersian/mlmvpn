// --- «مسیر برنامه‌ها»: which apps use the tunnel (Android's split tunnel, on Windows) ---
//
// Android's advanced VPN settings pick per app: every app through the VPN, only the chosen ones,
// or everyone except the chosen ones. Android does it with VpnService.Builder.addAllowed/
// addDisallowedApplication; on Windows the same choice is a routing rule in the full-system
// tunnel — sing-box sees which process owns each connection and routes it by `process_name`.
//
// This module is the one owner of that choice (the way Android's NetworkSettings owns the network
// settings): it is saved in ~/.mlmvpn/app-routing.json, tun-manager reads it every time it builds
// a tunnel, and no engine keeps a copy.
//
// WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO, said plainly because it decides whether the user can trust it:
//   * It acts on the FULL-SYSTEM TUNNEL (V2Ray's «تونل», the WARP engines, Google Script). The
//     system proxy is a suggestion each app takes or ignores, so there is no per-app choice to
//     make there — the Settings page says so.
//   * DNS is not per app on Windows: most programs ask the DNS Client service (svchost), not the
//     network themselves. So lookups stay in the tunnel for everyone and only CONNECTIONS follow
//     the choice. A bypassed app still reaches the right site; it just goes there directly.
//   * The engines' own processes are never offered and never honoured if they slip in: routing
//     an engine's uplink back into itself is the loop tun-manager exists to prevent.
