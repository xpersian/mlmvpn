// It lives in its own module because both sides of that handshake need it and they cannot
// require each other: gt-broker.js signs requests with it, and gt-broker-deploy.js has to
// hand it to the Worker as an encrypted binding at upload time so the Worker can verify.
// Importing one from the other would close a require cycle.
