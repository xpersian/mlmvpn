// --- GitHub Tunnel: how much Actions capacity an account actually has left ---
//
// WHAT GITHUB REALLY GIVES US — CHECKED AGAINST THE LIVE API, NOT ASSUMED
//
//  1. GET /users/{login}/settings/billing/actions
//     Returns included_minutes, total_minutes_used, total_paid_minutes_used and a
//     per-OS breakdown. This is the ONLY authoritative source, and the only one that
//     knows the account's real allowance — which is plan-dependent, so it is read rather
//     than hardcoded. It requires the `user` OAuth scope: called with this feature's
//     historical `repo, workflow` token it answers 404 with
//     `X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user`.
//
//  2. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{id}/timing -> billable.WINDOWS.total_ms
//     UNUSABLE. It reports 0. Measured on this project's own repository: twelve runs,
//     1,418 minutes of real Windows runner time, `billable` zero on every single one,
//     including a completed 335-minute success. It is a known GitHub bug, not a quirk of
//     one account, and anything built on it would silently report infinite capacity.
//
//  3. The SAME endpoint's run_duration_ms IS correct (335.6 / 264.0 / 64.1 minutes on
//     those runs). So wall-clock time per run is reliable even though billed time is not.
//
// THEREFORE, TWO SOURCES, ALWAYS LABELLED:
//
//   'measured'  — from (1). Real numbers, real allowance, whole account.
//   'estimated' — from (3): sum of run_duration_ms for OUR repository in this cycle,
//                 multiplied by the runner's billing multiplier. This is a LOWER BOUND:
//                 it cannot see minutes the same account spent on its other repositories.
//                 It is presented as a floor, never as a remaining balance.
//   'unknown'   — neither is available. A legitimate answer. Never substituted with a
//                 plausible-looking number.
//
// Nothing here ever invents an allowance. When the allowance is unknown, the account stays
// selectable and the ground truth comes from the only signal that never lies: whether a
// dispatched run actually starts (see gt-deployer.js).

// allowance buys twice the sessions.

// more sessions they could take — never as an eligibility gate, because GitHub itself
// checks the allowance at dispatch time and will happily let a run start with less than a
// full session's worth remaining (and simply overrun).

 * plan this feature is aimed at — that matches. For paid plans whose cycle is anchored to
 * the signup date it can be off by up to a month.
 *
 * The consequence is bounded on purpose: the cycle key only groups the ESTIMATE and the
 * history. Measured numbers come from GitHub's own counter, which GitHub resets on the
 * real date whatever we think the month is. So a wrong cycle boundary can make the
 * estimate pessimistic for a few days; it can never make a measured figure wrong.
