//
// WHY AN IP RULE WHEN THERE IS ALREADY A process_name RULE.
//
// Excluding the engine by process name is the correct idea and it usually works — but on
// Windows it is not reliable. sing-box has to ask the OS which process owns a socket, and for
// some sockets it simply cannot:
//
//     router: failed to search process: Access is denied.
//
// When that lookup fails the process rule cannot match, and the packet falls through every

// are handed to the SOCKS port that the engine itself is serving. Caught live in the log:
//
//     inbound/tun[tun-in]: inbound packet connection to 162.159.198.1:443
//     outbound/socks[aether]: outbound packet connection to 162.159.198.1:443

// That is the tunnel eating its own uplink. Nothing crashes and nothing is logged as an error;

 * connection to dns.google (or Cloudflare, Quad9, NextDNS…) and resolves there. Inside a tunnel
 * that costs seconds per name, and every piece of work this file does to make DNS fast and

 *     DoH cloudflare-dns.com  HTTP 200   7207 ms

 * browser that will not wait that long, the result is «اینترنت قطع است» on a tunnel that is
 * working perfectly — the same page opened in 3.5 s from a process using the system resolver,
 * in the same minute.
 *
 * A REJECT, not a drop: a browser that sees its DoH server refused marks it as failing and
 * falls back to the system resolver within one attempt, which is this tunnel's own DNS. A
 * silent drop makes it wait for a timeout first, every time.
 *
 * Matched by DOMAIN, which is what keeps it safe: the tunnel's own upstream resolver is dialled

/**
 * Split-tunnel config: the tunnel is used only where it is the only thing that works.
 *
 * buildTunConfig() above sends everything through the proxy. That opens every site, but it
 * also drags Iranian traffic and ordinary foreign traffic across the world for no reason.
 * This variant splits by destination:
 *
 *   Iranian names/IPs        -> direct, at full local speed
 *   DNS-poisoned sites       -> direct; the honest answer from the DoH worker is the whole
 *                               fix, so no tunnel is involved and no speed is lost
 *   IP/SNI-blocked sites     -> tunnel, because nothing else reaches them
 *   sanctioned services      -> tunnel, because they refuse Iranian IPs
 *   ad/tracker hosts         -> rejected outright
 *
 * `fallback` decides the unknown case, and it is a real trade the user has to own:
 *   'direct'  fastest; a blocked site that is not on the list will not open
 *   'tunnel'  everything opens; ordinary foreign sites pay the tunnel's latency
 *
 * `dohUrl` is the user's own DoH worker. Every lookup goes there, off the tunnel, so
 * poisoned answers are gone before routing decisions are made — and the routing decisions
 * themselves stay fast because they never wait on the proxy.

/**
 * Game-only routing: everything goes DIRECT except the game's own processes.
 *
 * This is the inverse of buildTunConfig(), and the inversion is the whole safety argument.
 *
 *   full tunnel   final: engine   — if the engine dies, the machine has no internet
 *   game mode     final: direct   — if the engine dies, the GAME stops working and
 *                                   nothing else even notices
 *
 * A player whose accelerator falls over mid-match should lose the match, not the internet.
 * So `final` is direct, DNS is never hijacked, and the only traffic that reaches the engine
 * is what an explicit process rule sends there. There is no leak to prevent here because
 * nothing is being hidden — this is an optimisation, not a privacy tunnel, and pretending
 * otherwise would be the dishonest kind of reuse.
 *
 * WHY THE ADAPTER IS STILL NEEDED AT ALL
 * Windows offers no way to say "send this program's UDP somewhere else" without owning the
 * packets first. auto_route pulls everything into the TUN, sing-box decides per connection,
 * and the ~all of it that is not the game is handed straight back to the physical
 * interface. That costs a userspace hop on ordinary traffic, which is the price of the
 * feature and is stated in the UI rather than hidden.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT CAN QUIETLY FAIL
 * `process_name` needs Windows to tell sing-box which process owns a socket, and it refuses
 * for some system-owned ones (logged as "failed to search process: Access is denied").
 * Games run as the user, so this normally works — but when it does not, the traffic simply
 * falls through to `final: direct` and the player is unaccelerated rather than disconnected.
 * `gameIps` exists for that case: any server address already learned is matched by address
 * as well, which needs no process lookup at all.

 * bytes that actually crossed the wire, and counting them avoids double-counting the same
 * payload once as the application's tunnelled traffic and again as the engine carrying it.
 *
 * `sawUplink` USED TO BE STICKY, AND THAT MADE THE COUNTER LIE. Once any engine connection had
 * been seen, this function committed to the uplink series for ever — and for a domain-fronted
 * engine that series is nearly always empty, because meek's uplink is a stream of short HTTP
 * round trips that are rarely open at the instant of a sample. Measured live on 2026-09-19 with
 * سایفون carrying six connections, 11.6 MB up and 2.5 MB down through the adapter:
 *
 *     front-speed  engineDown=0.11  tunDown=0.00

 *     stall idle=20s :: تونل بالاست ولی ۲۰ ثانیه است هیچ بایتی رد نشده
 *
 * A working tunnel, reported as carrying nothing, with a stall warning on top — and every
 * consumer of this number believed it: the live speed display, the diary, the stall detector and
 * the leak check, which compares these bytes against the engine's own.
 *
 * So the choice is made per snapshot, and the series that produced the answer is named. A caller

 * THE LAST THING BETWEEN A BUILDER'S BUG AND A TOTAL LEAK.
 *
 * A sing-box routing/DNS rule is a set of conditions. A rule whose condition lists are all
 * EMPTY has no conditions at all — and a rule with no conditions matches EVERYTHING. There is
 * no warning: `sing-box check` accepts it, the engine starts, and the rule quietly becomes a
 * catch-all at whatever position it sits in.
 *
 * That shipped. `{ ip_cidr: uplinkCidrs, outbound: 'direct' }` was emitted unconditionally,
 * and `uplinkCidrs` is empty for every config whose address is a NAME instead of a clean IP —
 * most Cloudflare configs. Third in the list, it sent the entire tunnel to `direct`:
 *   · ordinary sites kept working, so the 256 KB payload check passed and the switch went green
 *   · filtered sites were reset by the ISP the moment they left in the clear
 *     (sing-box log: raw-read tcp 192.168.8.6:…->142.251.155.4:443 … forcibly closed)
 *   · and «تونل کامل — بدون نشتی» was on over a connection carrying the user's real address.
 *
 * Each site that builds such a rule guards it now, but a guard that must be remembered every
 * time is not a guarantee. This runs over the finished config and removes any rule that has
 * no condition left, so the failure can only ever be "one exclusion missing" — never "the
 * tunnel is a passthrough". `action`/`outbound`/`server`/`invert`/`network`-only rules are not
 * conditions on their own; anything else present means the rule really is conditioned.

// One adapter, many features. Most of them start it and stop it and keep nothing hanging off it.
// GitHub Tunnel v2 is different: its full tunnel rides this adapter AND a kill-switch, a DNS block
// and an IPv6 block are built around it. If another feature simply took the adapter over — the
// V2Ray switch, the game tab, the WARP switch — those guards would outlive the tunnel they were
// for: a block-by-default firewall that now blocks the NEW owner's engine too, i.e. no internet,
// while the GitHub panel still read «connected».
//
// So a feature can register as the owner when it starts the tunnel (`options.owner` plus
// `options.onPreempted`). Anyone ELSE who stops or replaces the tunnel while it is registered
// makes this module call the owner's hook first — and WAIT for it, so the guards are down before
// the new owner's engine needs the network. Features that never register behave exactly as
// before. The hook must not take locks its caller might hold (it runs inside their transition).
//
// The hook is told what comes NEXT when a new tunnel is the reason (`next`: its SOCKS port and
